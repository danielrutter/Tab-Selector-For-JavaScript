# Tab-Selector-For-JavaScript
Tab Selector For JavaScript x 2 TABS (selects between one and the other on tab click)

This script was first created by Daniel William Rutter at danielrutter.com, with the aim of being
released entirely into the public domain. This script was first developed for a previous project, in
order to display two Twitter profiles on 1 page, that Daniel volunteered to do for free, where
permission was granted to use what was developed in future projects and releases such as this one.

NOTE: This script allows you to select between 2 tabs, where you can display content from page load as TAB 1,
where you can select between TAB 2 and back to TAB 1, without losing any content from page load.
